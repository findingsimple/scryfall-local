## Context7 MCP Integration

Always use Context7 MCP when I need library/API documentation, code generation, setup or configuration steps without me having to explicitly ask.

**Use Context7 for:**
- Library/framework documentation lookups
- API reference documentation
- Code generation with specific libraries
- Setup and configuration steps for tools/frameworks
- Best practices for libraries and frameworks

**How to use it:**
1. Automatically resolve library IDs when a library is mentioned
2. Fetch documentation proactively when working with libraries
3. Don't wait for me to ask - use it when it would be helpful
